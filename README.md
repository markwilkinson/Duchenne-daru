This contains two demonstrations:

* CountsTutorial.ipynb - a demonstration of the "counting case":  How many patients with a given diagnosis are present in this registry?
* Phenotype_frequencies_tutorial.ipynb - How many times does a particular phenotype appear in a registry (multiple appearances in the same patient is counted as a single observation)
